# Pixel-Manipulation-for-Image-Encryption
This project demonstrates a basic image encryption and decryption tool by manipulating pixel values. The tool allows users to encrypt an image by applying simple mathematical operations (such as XOR or pixel value swaps) and then decrypt the image to retrieve the original.
